# PCA practical

## Introduction

In this practical we will do principal component analysis (PCA), which is one of the fundamental tools of population genetics for identifying sample clustering and outliers. As explained in the talk by Gavin PCA is way of reducing a multidimensional space of data points to a set of orthogonal principal components that represent "directions" of greatest variance.  These may reflect population structure, but might also reflect cryptic relationships, poor QC, or other effects that lead to differences in genotype distribution.
