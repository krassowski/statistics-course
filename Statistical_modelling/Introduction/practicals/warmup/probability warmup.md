## Probability warm-up

Here are a couple of questions that use the formulae on the probability cheatsheet.

### Inheriting DNA

**Question.** Suppose v<sub>1</sub> and v<sub>2</sub> are two genetic variants on the same
chromosome and that there is 30% chance of recombination between them in each meiosis. If Sofiane
and Ignacy are siblings, what is the probability they inherit the same copy of v1 and v2 (and the
segment in between) from their mother?

### Testing COVID

**Question.** Covid-19 lateral flow tests currently in use [are thought to be pretty
accurate](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-11-11-oxford-university-and-phe-confirm-lateral-flow-tests-
 show-high-specificity-and-are). Suppose that
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=P(\text{positive}|\text{not infected}) = 0.002">
(i.e. the false positive rate is 0.2%) and
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=P(\text{positive}|\text{infected}) = 0.8">
(i.e. the specificity is 80%).

And let's suppose that [about 0.4% of people in Oxfordshire are infected](https://phdashboard.oxfordshire.gov.uk):
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=P(\text{infected}) = 0.004">

Suppose you test positive.  How likely are you to have COVID?
