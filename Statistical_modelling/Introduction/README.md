GMS Statistical Modelling I - introduction to statistical modelling
===========================

Overview
--------

This course will introduce students to basic conceptual and practical aspects of statistical
modelling.  This will include studying the use and behaviour of likelihood functions, practical
aspects and methods around estimation and hypothesis testing, and the use of summary statistics
to perform inference.  Practicals will focus on examples including logistic regression and
meta-analysis. 

Prerequisites
--------------

- Be able to estimate an odds ratio from a 2x2 table, and a test of significance of the odds ratio.
- Basic R programming skills

Learning objectives
-------------------

- An overall understanding of the aims and practice of statistical inference.
- Understand the formal components of likelihood-based models are - the likelihood, the prior, and the posterior.
- Understand 2x2 table examples and logistic regression.
- Understand the asymptotic behaviour of likelihoods and how summary statistics can be used to perform approximate inference.
- Know how to use computational approaches to deal with cases where the asymptotics don't work.
- Understand the ideas of estimation and hypothesis testing in the context of statistical modelling.
- Implement and visualise some simple models using R

Required software
-----------------

Please ensure you have this software installed on your laptop prior to the start of the course.
