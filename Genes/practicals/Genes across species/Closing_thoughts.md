## Closing thoughts

In this tutorial we've covered a number of programming topics - 

- understanding gene annotation data
- basic python programming
- using dataframes (in pandas)
- techniques for writing clear and reusable code
- writing useful command-line programs
- sql and sqlite
- working with genomic ranges

We've used that to analyse gene content within and across species - with some hopefully interesting
results.

As we wrote in the [introduction](Introduction.md), this analysis is pretty typical of
bioinformatics analysis you might do in practice - there's a fairly large amount of data, and some
code is needed to make sense of it. This tutorial has hopefully given you a sense of useful ways to
approach this type of thing.  (Or did you find your own, better way?)
