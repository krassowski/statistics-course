
## Where to get data

- The file [`samples.tsv`](samples.tsv) contains a list of samples used in this tutorial.

- You can download them from the FTP links provided at the [European Nucleotide Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home).

- To make the data a bit 'lighter', I sub-sampled these read files to make them a bit smaller.
You can download the subsampled files from [here](https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gav/projects/gms/statistics-course/Next_Generation_Sequencing/practicals/ngs_processing_pipeline/subsampled/).
